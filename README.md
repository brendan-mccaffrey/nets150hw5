# The Stock Prophecy User Manual

This program, developed by Brendan McCaffrey and [Emanuel Kuflik](https://github.com/MannyKuflik), is a simple Java application that utilizes web scraping, cosine similarity vectors, and Java Swing UI to give the user an enjoyable and valuable experience. 

### Project Description

The application presents the user with a welcome screen in which he/she can input his/her name and the ticker of a stock they like, along with other optional settings. The user then selects to receive a single stock recommendation or a full portfolio of stocks put together by our algorithms. Our program utilizes cosine similarity and real-time web-scraping of financial information to come up with the best stocks for the user.

### Running the Program
